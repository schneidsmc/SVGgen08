## User Story

AS a freelance web developer I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input:

- WHEN I am prompted for text THEN I can enter up to three characters
- WHEN I am prompted for the text color THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- WHEN I am prompted for a shape THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
- WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
- WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
